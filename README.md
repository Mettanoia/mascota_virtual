**Title:** Development of the Virtual Pet Caring Application: A Collaborative Journey

---

**Introduction**

This presentation outlines the collaborative process we undertook to develop a virtual pet caring application. It highlights the key interactions, challenges faced, and solutions implemented. The focus is on the most significant prompts and responses that shaped the application's development.

---

**1. Project Conceptualization**

- **User's Vision:**
  - Create a virtual pet caring app set in a paradise-like background.
  - Display animated pet images that move and bounce to simulate walking or movement.
  - Allow users to interact with pets by clicking on them to feed or give gifts.
  - Include features to create new pets and display their state (mood and energy) in a pop-up.
  - Implement a simple front-end with all logic in a single file and back-end endpoints using Java with Spring and WebFlux.

**2. Front-End Development**

- **Setting Up the Environment:**
  - **HTML Structure:**
    - Created a main container for the Eden environment.
    - Included pet images with unique IDs corresponding to back-end data.
    - Added a "Create New Creature" button and interaction pop-ups.
  - **CSS Styling:**
    - Applied a paradise-like background image.
    - Used CSS animations to make pets move and bounce randomly.
    - Ensured each pet had unique animation parameters for variety.

- **JavaScript Logic:**
  - **Rendering Pets:**
    - Fetched the list of pets from the back-end upon page load.
    - Rendered pets on the page with random positions and animations.
  - **Interacting with Pets:**
    - Added click event listeners to pet images to display interaction pop-ups.
    - Pop-ups showed pet's name, mood, and energy fetched from the back-end.
    - Provided options to feed or give gifts, updating the pet's state via back-end calls.
  - **Creating New Pets:**
    - Implemented a pop-up form to enter a new pet's name.
    - Sent a POST request to the back-end to create the pet.
    - Updated the front-end to display the new pet upon creation.

**3. Back-End Development**

- **Implementing Endpoints with Spring WebFlux:**
  - **GET `/`**: Served the `index.html` page.
  - **GET `/creatures`**: Returned a list of all pets.
  - **POST `/creatures`**: Created a new pet with a unique ID and default state.
  - **GET `/creatures/{id}`**: Retrieved details of a specific pet.
  - **POST `/creatures/{id}/interact`**: Updated a pet's state based on interactions.
  - **DELETE `/creatures/{id}`**: Removed a pet from the in-memory data store.

- **Managing Pet Data:**
  - Used an in-memory `ConcurrentHashMap` to store pet data.
  - Each pet had properties: `id`, `name`, `imageUrl`, `mood`, and `energy`.
  - Initialized with some default pets for demonstration.

- **Serving Static Resources:**
  - Placed `index.html` and images in the `src/main/resources/static` directory.
  - Allowed Spring Boot to serve static content without additional configuration.

---

**4. Troubleshooting and Solutions**

- **Issue: Missing Getters and Setters in `Creature` Class**
  - **Problem:** Encountered errors like `cannot find symbol method setMood(String)`.
  - **Solution:** Added getter and setter methods for all properties in the `Creature` class to ensure proper access and modification.

- **Issue: Front-End Not Working When Served by Spring Boot**
  - **Problem:** The front-end worked when opened directly in the browser but not when served through the back-end.
  - **Solution:**
    - Ensured resource paths were correct and used absolute URLs.
    - Checked and configured CORS settings to allow cross-origin requests if necessary.
    - Verified that static resources were being served from the correct directory.
    - Used the browser's developer tools to debug and identify issues.

- **Issue: "Create" and "Delete" Functionality Not Working**
  - **Problem:** Clicking "Create" didn't add a new pet, and there was no way to delete pets.
  - **Solution:**
    - **For Creating Pets:**
      - Implemented the `createCreature` handler method in the back-end to handle POST requests to `/creatures`.
      - Updated the front-end to send the correct data and refresh the pet list upon creation.
    - **For Deleting Pets:**
      - Added a "Delete" button in the interaction pop-up on the front-end.
      - Implemented the `deleteCreature` handler method in the back-end to handle DELETE requests to `/creatures/{id}`.
      - Updated the front-end to remove the pet from the display after deletion.

**5. Final Implementation**

- **Front-End Features:**
  - Animated pets displayed over a paradise-like background.
  - Unique animations for each pet to enhance visual appeal.
  - Interaction pop-ups showing pet's state and options to feed, give gifts, or delete.
  - Ability to create new pets through a user-friendly interface.

- **Back-End Services:**
  - Handled all CRUD operations for pets via RESTful endpoints.
  - Managed pet data in-memory for simplicity.
  - Served static resources efficiently.

---

**Conclusion**

Through collaborative problem-solving and iterative development, we successfully created a virtual pet caring application that met the outlined requirements. The application provides an engaging user experience with interactive pets in a vibrant environment.

**Next Steps:**

- **Data Persistence:** Integrate a database to store pet data persistently.
- **Enhancements:**
  - Add more interaction options (e.g., playing, grooming).
  - Allow customization of pet appearances.
  - Implement user authentication to save individual user progress.
- **Error Handling:** Improve validation and error feedback for a smoother user experience.
